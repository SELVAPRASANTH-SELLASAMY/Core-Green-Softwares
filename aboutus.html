        <h2>Founding and Early Years (2010-2012)</h2>
        <p>Core Green Softwares was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate software engineers with a vision to create innovative and sustainable software solutions. The founding team, consisting of John Doe, Jane Smith, and Michael Johnson, brought together their diverse expertise in software development, project management, and environmental sustainability. They shared a common goal: to build software that not only met the highest standards of functionality and user experience but also contributed positively to the environment.</p>
        <p>Starting as a small startup in a modest office space, Core Green Softwares faced numerous challenges in its early years. The team focused on developing customized software solutions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), gradually building a reputation for delivering high-quality, reliable, and eco-friendly products. The company's commitment to sustainability was evident from the beginning, with initiatives such as using energy-efficient servers and promoting remote work to reduce carbon footprints.
